#### Last edited time of the article: 2020/03/26
This is a visualization and simple analysis project about Coronavirus COVID-19. I used the confirmed cases data to visualize and investigate the current "Curve" through basic data science approach. This repo focuses on only the ETL (Data cleaning) and visualization. Please read the full Medium article here:

## Acknowledge
Please keep in mind that the source data are still undergoing rapid developing. I will keep updating the notebook as much as I could. I am a data science practitioner and have little knowledge in Epidemiology. This is an attempt to apply analysis skill to translate the data into understandable information (Report and EDA). If I made any inaccurate information or you have any thoughts on the article, please let me know!
